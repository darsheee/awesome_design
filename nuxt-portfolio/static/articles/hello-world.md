It's time to soft launch my new personal websiteâ€“built with <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt</a>.

I was tired of writing and building with WordPress for personal projects. Not to mention the fact that my installation was constantly being hacked. Handling the security of WordPress was becoming a chore, and I needed something that would be substantially easier to maintain.

I think I've achieved that with a more modern stack, and it's one that's quite a bit of fun to work on. I'm looking forward to working on this.
