It's time to soft launch my new personal websiteâ€“built with <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt</a>.

I was tired of writing and building with WordPress for personal projects. Not to mention the fact that my installation was constantly being hacked. Handling the security of WordPress was becoming a chore, and I needed something that would be substantially easier to maintain.

I think I've achieved that with a more modern stack, and it's one that's quite a bit of fun to work on. I'm looking forward to working on this.

### Short list of to-do's

* Build out a handful of case studies of recent work
* Write a bit more about the build process, development discoveries
* Improve the UX of this epxerience
* Find better ways to process these markdown files

This is definitely a work in progress sort of situation, but I'm having fun again.
