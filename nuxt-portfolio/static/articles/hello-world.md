As I embark on something new in my development journey, I figure I ought to reintroduce this space.

I was tired of writing and building with WordPress for personal projects. Not to mention the fact that my installation was continually getting hacked/attacked. I need something that required less maintenance and was a bit more fun.

I think I've achieved that, as I'm primarily using this website as a place to write as well as a place to showcase my work. I have yet to build out that feature, but I'm guessing it'll be a more static experience.
