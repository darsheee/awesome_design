description: Using a CMS that generates the sort of markdown files I was tired of
  creating manually.

From a certain perspective I'm still building a static website with markdown files and avoiding dealing with an API. It's overkill in this situation. My initial efforts were geared towards manually creating markdown files and loading those with a manually generated JSON file listing all of the available content.

That was not ideal.

I started working towards dynamically generating that information, but was still a little tired of creating the posts.md files necessary. That's when I discovered forestry.io. I'll do a bit more of a process write up in the future, but for now I'm willing to see how this all goes.
