  title: Design & Development
  body: <strong>I&rsquo;ve worked for over 13-years</strong> as a designer and developer on the web. 
      At every professional stop I&rsquo;ve been a hybrid in a creative or production based role and 
      have a broad knowledge base because of it. I'm passionate about building things for the web, 
      and I'd love to help. I'm open to interesting freelance opportunities, so if I seem like a fit, 
      please reach out.
