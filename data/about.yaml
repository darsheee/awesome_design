  title: A Little History
  body: <p>I&rsquo;ve worked for over 13-years as a designer and developer on the web.

      and couldn't imagine a life without it.</p>

      <p>I am currently working as a senior UI/UX Developer at Aisle Rocket. I work on a wide variety
      of brands and projects involving product launches, component driven product design, and
