  subtitle: It&rsquo;s great to meet you! I&rsquo;ve worked for over 14 years as a designer and developer 
            on the web in a largely hybrid-based role. To get a feel for my place in the development
        world, I'll refer you to

  title: A Little About Me
  body: <p>In my current role as a senior UX/UI Developer at Aisle Rocket I work on a wide variety
        of brands and projects involving CPG product launches, component driven product design, and
        internal tools. I'm largely focused on experience development for mass market brands.</p>
        <p>In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my wife and pets, reading, keeping up with 
        politics (to the detriment of our collective health these days), woodworking, home improvement 
        projects, and sipping a fine craft beer.</p>
