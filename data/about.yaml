statement:
  title: Development &amp; Design Focused
  body: <p><strong>I&rsquo;ve worked for over 13-years</strong> as a designer and developer on the web. 
      At every professional stop I&rsquo;ve been a hybrid in a creative or production based role and 
      have a broad knowledge base because of it. I'm passionate about building things for the web, 
      and couldn't imagine a life without it.</p>

      <p>I am currently working as a senior UI/UX Developer at Aisle Rocket.</p>
