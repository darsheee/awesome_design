  title: A Little About Me
  body:
    <p>I grew up in Michigan and got into web development in my early teenage years &mdash; the late 1990&rsquo;s otherwise known as the
    era of table based layouts. Back then I was more of an avid gamer than I am now and I really
    enjoyed the Dark Forces series. I and even
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990202084434/http://www.jediknight.net/yoda/" target="_blank">created a website</a>
    dedicated to mods for the Jedi Knight iteration.</p>
    <p>From there, the path to my future career was set.</p>
    <p>Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my wife and pets, reading, keeping up with
    politics, woodworking, home improvement projects, and sipping a fine craft beer.</p>
