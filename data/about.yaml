  title: A Little About Me
  body: <p>I&rsquo;ve worked for over 14 years as a designer and developer on the web in a hybrid-based 
        role and have a broad knowledge base because of it. To get a feel for my place in the development
        world, I'll refer you to 
        <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design-react-and-a-bridge-over-the-great-divide/">this</a>.</p>
        <p>In my current role as a senior UX/UI Developer at Aisle Rocket I work on a wide variety
        of brands and projects involving CPG product launches, component driven product design, and
        internal tools. I'm largely focused on experience development for mass market brands.</p>
        <p>In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my wife and pets, reading, keeping up with 
        politics (to the detriment of our collective health these days), woodworking, home improvement 
        projects, and sipping a fine craft beer.</p>
