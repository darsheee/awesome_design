  subtitle: I share a whole host of content on this blog. In some cases it will relate heavily
            to my professional life, but more often than not it&rsquo;s just a bunch of topics 
            that interest me.

  title: A Little About Me
  body: <p>I currently work as a UI Engineer at AccuLynx.</p>
        <p>Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my wife and pets, reading, keeping up with 
        politics (to the detriment of our collective health these days), woodworking, home improvement 
        projects, and sipping a fine craft beer.</p>
