So, again, I'm not against the use of Tailwind, but I think Tero Piirainen hits the nail on the head in [this article](https://nuejs.org/blog/tailwind-misinformation-engine/).

> I started web development at the age of a ~blink~ tag and CSS has always been my favorite part of the web development stack. I'm particularly fascinated about the crossing between design and front-of-the frontend...[the introduction of Internet Explorer 4.0] nailed me to the separation of concerns pattern

The ethos was similarly driven into my head.

> Fast forward to this date, and the solid foundation has almost disappeared. Styling is inlined and CSS is written with JavaScript. There are no element types, nor contexts. Styling is flat and not cascading. Global is feared instead of used.

Read the article, but I think the above is why it feels so wrong. The resulting markup and classes are bloated and gross in comparison to the world I came from.
