Via [Kottke](http://www.kottke.org/remainder/08/04/15529.html): One of the [best lists](http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/49772.html) Iâ€™ve seen compiled on why we study history, and some of them are certainly why I find it to be so fascinating. For instance:

> (3.) The past is analogue: a contemporary issue or problem resembles some past issue or problem; the historical example has just enough distance from our own situation that we understand ourselves better. Barbara Tuchman, A Distant Mirror; Lisa Jardine, Worldly Goods.
