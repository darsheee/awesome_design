> Via Bruce I stumbled upon this interesting Hacker News discussion under the ominous title “Is web programming a series of hacks on hacks?” Thingy’s law applies, so the answer is No, but it’s a qualified No, and we need to understand what we should do in order to avoid a future Yes.

There is so much going on in web development that is difficult to keep track of. I often feel lost in the sea of progress. [Worth](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2016/09/web_development.html?utm_source=html5weekly&utm_medium=email) a read.
