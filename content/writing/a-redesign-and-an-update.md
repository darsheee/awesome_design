There's no question about it, I sat on this site for a year kind of waiting for [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com)'s release. I've officially worked with Vue 3 in a professional capacity for the vast majority of that time, and I probably could have continued to add content here, but alas I just couldn't bring myself to work on anything after-hours.
