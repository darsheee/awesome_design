Guys, if you’re not already aware of it, you should learn now: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is a powerful alternative to [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/). It’s collaborative, browser based, and highly flexible.

> Well… I loved Sketch.
> 
> Until I started working on a cross-platform design system. Until I tried to implement nested symbols to keep my UI consistent. Until I tried to work with Sketch files in a team environment. Until I tried to hand off Sketch files to developers and had to pay for an additional subscription to a different tool. Until I had another sketch plugin or program that I rely on a little bit too much forget to update itself with a new release. Until I tried to figure out how to design with constraints in mind.
