From a certain perspective I'm still building a static website with markdown files and avoiding dealing with an API&mdash;an API would be overkill in this situation. 

My initial efforts were geared towards manually creating markdown files and loading those by iterating over a manually generated JSON file. Sort of a poor imitation of what an API might return after a query. That was not ideal and not really how I wanted to handle it long term since it was not scalable.

I started working towards dynamically generating that information, but was still a little tired of creating the posts.md files necessary. That's when I discovered forestry.io. I'll do a bit more of a process write up in the future, but for now I'm willing to see how this all goes.

So far, this fits the work flow in a much nicer way.
