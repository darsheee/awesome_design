## A Little About Me

I was born and raised in Michigan, went to college and lived in Florida for a couple of years, then made my way back to enjoy the wonderful lakes and summer experience. If Michigan could exist in a slightly different winter climate, it would be just about perfect.

I spent my teenage years tinkering with old computers with my dad—he always found these old hunks of junk to play with—which lead me to learn `BASIC`. Some of my best memories were rehabbing these old systems until we started to build our own and eventually get ourselves connected to the internet with dial-up. Holy shit, was that an eye-opening experience.

Shortly after that, in the era of table based layouts, I started to learn the basics of `html/css`. Back then I was more of an avid gamer than I am now, and I really enjoyed the Dark Forces series. I [created a website](https://web.archive.org/web/19990202084434/http://www.jediknight.net/yoda/) dedicated to mods for the Jedi Knight iteration, and decided around that time to turn web design and development into a career.

Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my wife and pets, reading, keeping up with politics, woodworking, home improvement projects, and sipping a fine craft beer.

### This Site

I’ve had *something* at this domain since 2005, running through various iterations of content management systems with my content focused on a personal portfolio or blog. Prior to the switch to Vue/Nuxt I had a self-hosted WordPress installation.

For professional development reasons in 2019, I made the **JAMstack** switch to learn the approach and that’s where it stands today. This site is available publicly on my GitHub, and you’re welcome to fork it and use it as a basis to build your own.
