## A Little About Me

Getting in to web development and design was a direct result of spending my teenage years tinkering with old computers with my dad. I attempted to learn `QBasic` on those old machines, and some of my best memories from childhood revolve around rehabbing these computers until we started to build our own. When we got ourselves connected to the internet with dial-up...holy shit, was that an eye-opening experience.

Not too long after that I started to learn the basics of `html` and got my start on [Geocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities). Being more of an avid gamer back then, and a stereotypical fan of Star Wars, I spent as many hours as I could playing through the Dark Forces series. I eventually [created a website](https://web.archive.org/web/19990202084434/http://www.jediknight.net/yoda/) dedicated to mods for the Jedi Knight iteration, and decided around that time to turn web design and development into a career.

### Present Day

I was born and raised in Michigan, went to college and lived in Florida, then made my way back to Michigan to enjoy the wonderful lakes and summer experience, and I've lived here ever since.

Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my wife and pets, reading, keeping up with politics, woodworking, home improvement projects, and sipping a fine craft beer.

### This Site

I’ve had *something* at this domain since 2005, running through various iterations of content management systems with my content focused on a personal portfolio or blog. Prior to the switch to Vue/Nuxt I had a self-hosted WordPress installation.

For professional development reasons in 2019, I made the **JAMstack** switch to learn the approach and that’s where it stands today. This site is available publicly on my GitHub, and you’re welcome to fork it and use it as a basis to build your own.
