## A Little About Me

Getting in to web development and design was a direct result of spending my teenage years tinkering with old computers with my dad—he always found these old hunks of junk to play with. I attempted to learn `BASIC` on those old machines. Some of my best memories were rehabbing these computers until we started to build our own. When we got ourselves connected to the internet with dial-up...holy shit, was that an eye-opening experience.

Not long after that, in the era of table based layouts, I started to learn the basics of `html/css`. Being more of an avid gamer back then, and I really enjoyed the Dark Forces series. I [created a website](https://web.archive.org/web/19990202084434/http://www.jediknight.net/yoda/) dedicated to mods for the Jedi Knight series, and decided around that time to turn web design and development into a career.

I was born and raised in Michigan, went to college and lived in Florida, then made my way back to Michigan to enjoy the wonderful lakes and summer experience, and I've lived here ever since.

Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my wife and pets, reading, keeping up with politics, woodworking, home improvement projects, and sipping a fine craft beer.

### This Site

I’ve had *something* at this domain since 2005, running through various iterations of content management systems with my content focused on a personal portfolio or blog. Prior to the switch to Vue/Nuxt I had a self-hosted WordPress installation.

For professional development reasons in 2019, I made the **JAMstack** switch to learn the approach and that’s where it stands today. This site is available publicly on my GitHub, and you’re welcome to fork it and use it as a basis to build your own.
