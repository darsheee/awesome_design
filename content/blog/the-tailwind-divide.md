Tailwind for me and my process is not as useful as writing the necessary `css`. It could be the `script`, `template`, and `style` blocks way of writing Vue SFCs that drives a lot of this, but my brain wasn't built for pure utility class usage.

Josh Collinsworth has this to say: 

> Tailwind is nearly as ubiquitous as it is polarizing these days. (I trust if you’ve been interested enough to read this far, I don’t need to cite any sources there.)
>
> Proponents show a near cult-like devotion to Tailwind, some even going so far as to claim it’s “fixed” CSS—or at the very least, made it manageable and predictable in a way it wasn’t for them before. Most frontend frameworks and products feature a first-class Tailwind integration, due to its soaring popularity.

> Detractors, on the other hand, claim Tailwind is messy; it gets in the way; it violates core fundamentals of web development; it cuts against the grain; it diminishes the power of CSS; and/or that it does the opposite of what it’s supposed to, adding complexity and making projects even harder to maintain.

I am in that latter camp because of my particular preferences and use cases, but I can see how useful it would be for, say, a React-based project and why that might make maintenance easier.

I think the overall conclusion being a matter of what a certain set of developers values has a lot of merit. I don't want to use Tailwind in its entirety, but I don't want to dismiss its utility either.
