I don't know what it was about watching Michigan football growing up that attracted me the most: the colors, the helmets, the uniforms--quite frankly it was probably all of it. What I do know is that over time I started to learn about the history and pageantry of the team and the sport, and I was sold.

My obsession with college football and offense grew while I played football in school and grew even more after I hung up the cleats for the last time. I just had to be informed, I had to understand what I was watching, I needed to consume the game in a way that went beyond the casual fan screaming at the screen to, "run the ball, tackle 'em!"

What I failed to appreciate while first getting into the Wolverines was the historical success the team had enjoyed. It wasn't necessarily elite success, but it was relatively well sustained.

At the end of the Lloyd Carr era I was entering adulthood with quite a large obsession still brewing. Any Michigan fan knows the era that came next, and it was awful as a fan. Two coaching staffs that produced terrible to mediocre results.
