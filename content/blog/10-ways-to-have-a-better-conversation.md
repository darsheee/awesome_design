I think in our tech heavy world we really don’t do the vast majority of what’s being suggested here–I struggle personally with 1, 6, 7, and 8–and connection with our fellow humans is a struggle as a result.

1. Don’t multitask.
2. Don’t pontificate.
3. Use open-ended questions.
4. Go with the flow.
5. If you don’t know, say that you don’t know.
6. Don’t equate your experience with theirs.
7. Try not to repeat yourself.
8. Stay out of the weeds.
9. Listen.
10. Be brief.
