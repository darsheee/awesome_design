# MikeMattner.com Built with Nuxt Edition

My second run at a javascript framwork based portfolio, blog, and general information site. I'm using `nuxt generate` to build a static website.

## ToDos

- [x] Dynamic generation of routes for .md files
- [x] Use a CMS for content generation (Forestry!)
- [ ] Generate, fill in some old content for the blog
- [ ] Reusable blog list component
- [ ] Blog pagination
- [ ] Build out portfolio with CMS capabilities
- [ ] Generate content for portfolio

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn run build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
